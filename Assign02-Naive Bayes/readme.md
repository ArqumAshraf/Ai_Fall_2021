Implementation of Multinomial Naive Bayes using 
No Smoothing (model name: NoMNB)
Laplace Smoothing (model name: LpMNB)
Lidstone Smoothing (set Alpha to 0.5) (model name: LdMNB)

Approach and Poroblem Faced:

The approach to assignment was done by the given instructions and links that helped to study the algorithm and by following the given steps the implementation was carried out.
The major problem faced was the implementation , the model didnt get fit as though the concept regarding smoothing basiaclly which is based on alpha value was created and clear.
Moreoverm, maximum parts of the assignment were implemented but unfortuantely unable to create submission due to unfit of the model.
