# Project Report

The approach to the task was by throroughly study and implementation to each algorithm assigned by the instructor.

The models used are :
## 1. Logistic Regression

## 2. Naive Bayes

## 3. KNN_Norm

## 4. KNN

## 5. LG_Norm

## 6. NY_Norm

Because by the study it gives much better accuracy and is easy to implement.

The accuracy of the above models are:
## 1.Logistic Regression gives 0.00104301
## 2.Naive Bayes gives 0.00073405
## 3.KNN_Norm gives 0.0045231
## 4.KNN gives 0.0325835
## 5. LG_Norm gives 0.00068408
## 6.NY_Norm gives  0.000762345

Though each algorithms accuracy ccan be varied by the splitting ratio and over the random state which was somewhere the problem in order to acheive the best acuracy.
